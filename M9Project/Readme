Disaster Tweets Classification Project
Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can identify whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and various machine learning algorithms, we analyze tweets to determine if they are announcing real disasters or using-related terms metaphorically.

Dataset
The dataset consists of 10,000 tweets that were hand-classified.

Features:
id: unique identifier for each tweet
text: the of the tweet
location: location of tweet (if available)
keyword: a keyword from the tweet (if available)
target: 1 if it's about a real disaster, 0 if not
